            <p>So, what do we do? I have a plan. (Biff’s Car) (He drives along, not noticing the flying DeLorean almost right behind him. Biff has the radio on.) (v.o) Repeating tonight's earlier weather bulletin, a severe thunderstorm is heading for Hill Valley.Right. (walks off) Save the clock tower. Where were we? Right about here. (They kiss right as Jennifer's Dad drives up.)You mean the past. Exactly!(he moves off to the side so he won't get run over.) Ready Marty? (starting up car) Ready! Set! (aims the pistol into the air.) (mumbling) Hi ho silver.(w.t) On the roof, 10-4. (Marty turns the corner to meet up with Biff's gang.) 3-Hey, it's him! And he's in disguise! Guys, what's that?Hey McFly, what do you think you're doing. (Marty turns, thinking they're talking to him.) Biff. (Biff ignores Marty and continues talking to the guy next to him.) Hey I'm talking to you, McFly, you Irish bug.(Blacksmith Shop) (Marty is changing into more suitable Western clothes. Doc is studying the photo of the tombstone with a magnifying glass.) "Shot in the back by Buford Tannen over a matter of 80 dollars!" September seventh! That's this Monday! Now I wish I'd paid him off! He points to the text at the bottom of the tombstone and talks to Marty. And whose this beloved Clara? I don't know anyone named Clara. I dunno, Doc. I thought maybe she was a girlfriend of yours. Marty. My involvement in such a social relationship, here in 1885, the result is a disruption of the space-time continuum. As a scientist, I can never take that risk, certainly not after we've already been through.</p>
